Want to help?
=============

I'd love to have help! Here are things I need help with:

* documentation work

  * verifying correctness of the existing documentation
  * fixing typos and errors in the documentation
  * fixing TODO items in the documentation
  * fixing flow issues -- if you're trying to get something done, are
    the important bits in the same place?
  * fixing missing documentation -- are there important things that
    aren't covered?
  * removing documentation -- are there things that are complex enough
    that we should change richard so we don't have to explain those
    things?

* styling work

  * make the default site look better
  * fix pages so they work well on desktop browsers and mobile
    browsers

* code work

  * correct egregious errors which are probably due to
    misunderstandings of how Django and other components work
  * working on issues (bugs and new features) listed in the issue
    tracker at https://github.com/pyvideo/richard/issues
  * fixing TODO items in the code

* testing work

  * write tests -- there's test infrastructure, but very few tests
  * test richard -- there are likely issues I haven't discovered, yet
  * test richard on browsers other than Firefox nightly -- I use
    Firefox nightly and haven't looked at richard on anything else
  * test richard on mobile devices -- does it work well in tablets?
    does it work well on phones? what issues should get fixed?

* community work

  * do you know other groups looking for video index software? tell
    them about richard, help them set up richard, ...

* project infrastructure work

  * is there infrastructure missing in this project that would make it
    easier for you to contribute? if so, what?

    is there infrastructure missing in this project that would make it
    easier to set up on PaaS systems or other systems? if so, what?


"Gah! That's a huge list! It's too daunting!" That's ok! Hop on IRC
and say hi and we can go from there!
